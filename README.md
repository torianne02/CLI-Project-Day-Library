# DayBooks

This gem has been created as an interactive book library for books written by famous romance author, Sylvia Day. This is completed by scraping Sylvia Day's book library page on goodreads.com. The purpose of this gem is to give a list of all books written by Sylvia Day to the user and ask the user for the title of the book they would like to read the description of. The description of the chosen book will be supplied and the user will be asked if they'd like to go back to the list of books to view one of the other book descriptions. Ultimately, the user is given the opportunity to view each one of Sylvia Day's book descriptions. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
